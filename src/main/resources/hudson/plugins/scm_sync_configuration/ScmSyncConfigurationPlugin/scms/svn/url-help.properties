description.1=Specify the subversion repository URL to synchronize your configuration files with, such as "http\://yourcompany.com/repos/hudson-config/"
description.2=When you enter a URL, Jenkins automatically checks if it can access the repository If access requires authentication, it will ask you the necessary credentials. If you already have a working credential but would like to change it for other reasons, click <a href\="{0}/scm/SubversionSCM/enterCredential" target\="_blank">this link</a> and specify different credentials.
description.3=Each time you enter a new repository URL, Jenkins will first synchronize all your configuration files with the repository. This process can take a while, depending on the amount of configuration files to synchronize.
