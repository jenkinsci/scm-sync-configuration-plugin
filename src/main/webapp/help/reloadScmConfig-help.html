    <strong>Beware</strong> : Some of your Jenkins config files can be overriden by this reload.<br/>
    That is to say, if you want to get your repository configuration files back, you can do it by clicking this link.<br/><br/>
    Following strategies will be applied :
    <table border="1" cellspacing="0">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Local (jenkins) file</th>
                <th>Repository file</th>
                <th>Action</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>XXX</td>
                <td>XXX (same as Jenkins one)</td>
                <td><em>Nothing</em></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>XXX</td>
                <td>YYY (different as Jenkins one)</td>
                <td>YYY will override XXX</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>XXX</td>
                <td><em>Doesn't exist</em></td>
                <td>
                    <em>Nothing</em> (Jenkins file won't be removed)<br/>
                    <em>Note that it should never happen since as soon as you activate scm sync config, every of your config file should be commited to the repository</em>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>job XXX</td>
                <td><em>Doesn't exist</em></td>
                <td>
                    <strong>Beware! Job will be removed!</strong> Opposite to jenkins config files, all jobs are removed before reload<br/>
                    <em>This is the only way to remove jobs that aren't stored in other branch or repo. After reload your Jenkins job configuration should be the same as in repository </em>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><em>Doesn't exist</em></td>
                <td>XXX</td>
                <td>
                    XXX will be imported from repository<br/>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
