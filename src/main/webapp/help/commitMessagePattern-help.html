    Pattern of the message which will be commited.<br/>
    For example, if you need to add a prefix/suffix to <em>every</em> of your commit messages,
    you can do it by changing this message pattern.<br/>
    You can use following "special" strings in the pattern :
    <ul>
        <li>`[message]` : Will be replaced by the generated commit message</li>
    </ul>

    ISSUE-1234: Modification on file with following comment : Synchronization init
