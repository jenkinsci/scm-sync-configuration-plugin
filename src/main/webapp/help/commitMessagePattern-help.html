<div>
    Pattern of the message which will be commited.<br/>
    For example, if you need to add a prefix/suffix to <em>every</em> of your commit messages,
    you can do it by changing this message pattern.<br/>
    You can use following "special" strings in the pattern :
    <ul>
        <li>`[message]` : Will be replaced by the generated commit message</li>
        <li>`[commitMessage]` : Will be replaced by the the comment you specified</li>
        <li>`[technicalMessage] : Will be replaced by the the technical details of the current commit`</li>
        <li>`[user] : Will be replaced by your Jenkins username`</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Example for using `[message]`:
    Writing a commit message of "Synchronization init" and defining a commit message pattern of "ISSUE-1234: [message]" <br/>
    will make following commit message :<br/>
    ISSUE-1234: Modification on file with following comment : Synchronization init
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If you need finer grained control the message above is equivalent to using a message pattern of:<br/>
    ISSUE-1234 [technicalMessage] by [user] with following comment: [commitMessage]
    <br/>
